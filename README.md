# RyanNetbots
This project was made by me for my AP Computer Science class. It won the tournament between the bots created by each student.

Netbots is not my creation, and the original netbots repo can be found here: https://github.com/dbakewel/netbots

This bot currently uses a binary search and moves in a hard to hit pattern, but does not account for other bots in movement and does not predict where bots will be for shooting.
