# RyanNetbots
Bot for netbots project by Ryan Stroebel.

Netbots is not my creation, and the original netbots repo can be found here: https://github.com/dbakewel/netbots 

This bot currently uses a binary search and moves in a hard to hit pattern, but does not account for other bots in movement and does not predict where bots will be for shooting.

This project was made for my AP Computer Science class. It won the tournament between the bots created by each student.
